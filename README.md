# Phishing-Websites-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Phishing, a prevalent cyber threat, exploits unsuspecting individuals through fraudulent websites to extract sensitive information like usernames, 
passwords, and financial data. As technology evolves, phishing tactics advance, necessitating robust anti-phishing measures for detection and 
prevention. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful ally in combating phishing, leveraging its capability to discern fraudulent activities 
efficiently. Among the machine learning algorithms utilized for phishing website detection, XGBoost stand out. XGBoost, an implementation of gradient 
boosted decision trees, is designed for speed and performance. It sequentially builds trees, each correcting the errors of its predecessors. Highly 
efficient and widely used in machine learning competitions and industry applications, XGBoost typically yields comparable or slightly better results 
than most of the algorithms in phishing website detection. Studies have reported accuracies ranging from 95\%, showcasing its effectiveness in 
identifying fraudulent websites. Phishing attacks pose significant challenges due to their deceptive nature. Attackers mimic legitimate websites, 
aiming to deceive users into divulging sensitive information. The ease of creating counterfeit websites, indistinguishable from genuine ones in layout 
and content, exacerbates the challenge. These replicas lure users into revealing sensitive information like account details and passwords. 
Additionally, attackers may pose security questions as a purported security measure, leading users into unwittingly compromising their information. 
Researchers are actively exploring strategies to thwart phishing attacks, emphasizing both website detection and user awareness. Machine learning 
algorithms such as XGBoost, have demonstrated efficiency in identifying phishing websites. However, proactive measures and user education remain 
crucial in combating phishing threats effectively.
